3125. Maximum Number That Makes Result of Bitwise AND Zero ðŸ”’
Description
Given an integer n, return the maximum integer x such that x <= n, and the bitwise AND of all the numbers in the range [x, n] is 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 7

Output: 3

Explanation:

The bitwise AND of [6, 7] is 6.
The bitwise AND of [5, 6, 7] is 4.
The bitwise AND of [4, 5, 6, 7] is 4.
The bitwise AND of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7] is 0.

Example 2:

Input: n = 9

Output: 7

Explanation:

The bitwise AND of [7, 8, 9] is 0.

Example 3:

Input: n = 17

Output: 15

Explanation:

The bitwise AND of [15, 16, 17] is 0.

 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1015


# java


class Solution {
  public long maxNumber(long n) {
    // assume n = 0b00...11???
    //        x = 0b00...01111
    //  since y = 0b00...10000 is in [x, n]
    //    and x & y = 0
    final int i = 63 - Long.numberOfLeadingZeros(n);
    return (1L << i) - 1;
  }
}


or


class Solution {
    public long maxNumber(long n) {
        return (1L << (63 - Long.numberOfLeadingZeros(n))) - 1;
    }
}
