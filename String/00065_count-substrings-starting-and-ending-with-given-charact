Hint
You are given a string s and a character c. Return the total number of substrings of s that start and end with c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abada", c = "a"

Output: 6

Explanation: Substrings starting and ending with "a" are: "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada", "abada".

Example 2:

Input: s = "zzz", c = "z"

Output: 6

Explanation: There are a total of 6 substrings in s and all start and end with "z".

 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s and c consist only of lowercase English letters.


# java


class Solution {
  public long countSubstrings(String s, char c) {
    final long freq = s.chars().filter(ch -> ch == c).count();
    return freq * (freq + 1) / 2;
  }
}

or


class Solution {
    public long countSubstrings(String s, char c) {
        long cnt = s.chars().filter(ch -> ch == c).count();
        return cnt + cnt * (cnt - 1) / 2;
    }
}
