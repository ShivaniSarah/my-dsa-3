3155. Maximum Number of Upgradable Servers ðŸ”’
Description
You have n data centers and need to upgrade their servers.

You are given four arrays count, upgrade, sell, and money of length n, which show:

The number of servers
The cost of upgrading a single server
The money you get by selling a server
The money you initially have
for each data center respectively.

Return an array answer, where for each data center, the corresponding element in answer represents the maximum number of servers that can be upgraded.

Note that the money from one data center cannot be used for another data center.

 

Example 1:

Input: count = [4,3], upgrade = [3,5], sell = [4,2], money = [8,9]

Output: [3,2]

Explanation:

For the first data center, if we sell one server, we'll have 8 + 4 = 12 units of money and we can upgrade the remaining 3 servers.

For the second data center, if we sell one server, we'll have 9 + 2 = 11 units of money and we can upgrade the remaining 2 servers.

Example 2:

Input: count = [1], upgrade = [2], sell = [1], money = [1]

Output: [0]

 

Constraints:

1 <= count.length == upgrade.length == sell.length == money.length <= 105
1 <= count[i], upgrade[i], sell[i], money[i] <= 105



# java



class Solution {
  public int[] maxUpgrades(int[] count, int[] upgrade, int[] sell, int[] money) {
    // If there's enough money, upgrade all servers; otherwise, optimize by
    // upgrading x servers. We have x * upgrade <= money + (count - x) * sell.
    // Therefore, x = (money + count * sell) / (sell + upgrade).
    int[] ans = new int[count.length];
    for (int i = 0; i < count.length; ++i)
      ans[i] = Math.min(count[i], //
                        (int) ((money[i] + 1L * count[i] * sell[i]) / (sell[i] + upgrade[i])));
    return ans;
  }
}

class Solution {
    public int[] maxUpgrades(int[] count, int[] upgrade, int[] sell, int[] money) {
        int n = count.length;
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            ans[i] = Math.min(
                count[i], (int) ((1L * count[i] * sell[i] + money[i]) / (upgrade[i] + sell[i])));
        }
        return ans;
    }
